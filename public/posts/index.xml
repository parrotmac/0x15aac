      <description>Hey there internet friend! I decided to re-launch my site using Hugo. After writing a little blog site in 2017 and then promptly forgetting about it, I&amp;rsquo;m back to actually be productive in writing posts :D
It turns out that running a full VM with a PostgreSQL database and multiple Docker containers may not be necessary to serve highly static content!
K.I.S.S.</description>

      <description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note: This was originally posted on my previous blog platform. While building that site was a great personal learning experience, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t totally practical to maintain and has since been replaced.
It seems only fitting to have the first post of a self-built blog to be about, well, the blog! I&amp;rsquo;ll list the technologies I used and why I chose them. In a later post I&amp;rsquo;ll cover details on how I put them together.</description>
