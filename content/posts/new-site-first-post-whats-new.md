Hey there internet friend! I decided to re-launch my site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). After writing a little blog site in 2017 and then promptly forgetting about it, I'm back to actually be productive in writing posts :D

It turns out that running a full VM with a PostgreSQL database and multiple Docker containers may not be necessary to serve highly static content!

K.I.S.S.
